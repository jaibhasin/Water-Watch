# Water-Watch
We have seen many instances where water is being waste unneccesarily in public places duty to some leaks or faults, orwater bodies being poluted etc. These problems sometimes get solved timely and sometimes late, which leads to so much water being wasted. So we created a portal where these problems can be solved with help of the people, all they have to do it take a picture of place where the water is being waste or polluted, describe the issue in a few lines and pin the location of the issue in the map. This information will then be sent to the concerned authories like the local government or municipal coporation who will address this issue as soon as possible. We have also created a comment section under issues where the people can discuss the solutions, plan to do community work or some other positive things. We have also included a news letter in the portal where the people can increase their knowledge through weekly quizes, articles and other informative and interesting videos.
